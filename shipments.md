# Plugging

1. A plug enlists customers.
2. A supplier lists an offer of a price per quantity with a time limit.
3. Customers start campaigns to purchase offers with staked DAI.
4. If the reserve is met, the bid is sent to the dealer for approval.
5. The staked DAI is moved to escrow.
6. The recipient is notified a package is incoming.
7. The supplier fulfills the order.
8. A local receives the package.
9. A courier moves the package to the plug.
10. The plug divides the package into orders.
11. Couriers deliver the orders.

In realtime, offers are local and shared between the dealer and their plugs.
